This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

If you choose to use our Application, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy.

# Information Collection and Use
## Firebase Authentication and Firestore
Our application employs Firebase Authentication to offer an optional sign-in feature. This feature allows users to save personalized settings associated to their account. Please note that the authentication is completely optional and primarily serves the purpose of preserving user-specific settings. Firebase Authentication collects and stores the email addresses of users who opt to register.

In addition, our application utilizes Firebase Firestore to store personalized settings for users who have chosen to sign in. These settings include, but are not limited to:

- Selected language preference
- Chosen city location
- Theme selection
- Filter values for timetable viewing

Firebase Firestore only collects and stores this information when a user has actively signed into the application. We do not collect or store personal settings for users who have not chosen to authenticate their account.

The application collect usage or crash reporting data.

Application collects diagnostic and usage data to improve our services and troubleshoot errors. These data can include for example things like details about the crashes, which screens are viewed the most or which features are popular.
