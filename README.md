# Yggert Nu

Experience the future of mobility with Yggert Nu! This app revolutionizes how you navigate through the city by aggregating all available modes of transport in one place.

## Micromobility

Yggert Nu's primary objective is to empower users in making informed decisions about their transport. It integrates all rental services, be it scooters, bikes, or cars, onto one convenient map. Now you can effortlessly choose the fastest and most convenient mode of transportation tailored to your needs.

And for those instances when no immediate transportation is nearby, you can easily check the local bus stops to view upcoming schedules and arrivals.
